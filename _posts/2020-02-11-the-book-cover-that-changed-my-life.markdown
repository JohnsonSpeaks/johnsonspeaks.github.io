I didn’t have a brother or sister growing up, and the block of council flats never offered up a friend, instead I would read. For as long as I remember I was always being told that I was reading above my age. Books about dogs and pretty fairies never interested me, even when I was properly young and girly, I always reached higher up the bookcase. I was desperate for bigger adventures, higher stakes, and a bit of terror.

I think I started to get disillusioned with reading, if I was made to read about one more puppy finding his way home I probably would’ve started a riot. One day I was walking through the local shopping centre when I stumbled upon a book stand covered in gold and black books, and a headline which read ‘SPOOKS’, I was instantly enthralled. These books looked as if they were made out of plain black leather, with gold minimalist writing, and an outline of a cloaked man on the cover; it was mysterious, and I wanted them. I picked one up and looked at the back to find the words ‘Warning: Do not read after dark’ and I was hooked.

My mum bought me the first 4 books in the series, after much convincing, and I went home and devoured them. I read all 4 books within the week. And then I read them again, and again, I lived off of them. They were scary and gory, and adventurous and brilliant. They were everything those goddamn fairy books weren’t - you know the ones.

I eventually brought them into school to try and get some of my friends to read them too, they did not, my parents were soon called in. Even though these books were for children, they were dark enough that my parents were repeatedly called into school because I was bringing in ‘mature content’. Instead of punishing me, my parents instead bought me the other books in the series and encouraged my reading of them.  

Having these books made me fall back in love with reading, I realised there was so much more out there. I didn’t have to read fluffy little stories about princesses who needed saving, I could read about witches and war and bravery instead. If I hadn’t been drawn in by a dark and mysterious cover with a warning sign, then I wouldn’t have taken up reading as a hobby and subsequently taken the path of publishing - so it’s not too much of an exaggeration to say that those book covers changed my life.
