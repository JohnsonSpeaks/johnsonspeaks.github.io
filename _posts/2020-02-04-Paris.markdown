On our way to Paris we slept on 3 different trains over a 4 hour period - we thought sleeping through our nerves would help, it didn’t. We thought that being away from home for months with no money and a serious lack of direction would be fun, and I guess it was in some ways.

We were tired before we even left the train station, Paris had a way of sapping your energy. After landing in Paris in the late afternoon, we stood aimlessly outside the Gare Du Norde to find a hostel that would take us, we were praying for a room in any inn. After running around (which we would later realise) the most dangerous part of the city, we found a hostel, featuring a room with a bunk bed and a single mattress on the floor. We were catcalled the second we left the hostel by a man pushing his young daughter in a pram.

We decided that we needed some real Parisian bread. Our search lead us into a market place where a man working there picked some bread off the shop floor and handed it to us - we ate it. We were followed by a man desperate to take photos of us, we ran back to our hostel. We decided to watch the sunset from our balcony, before taking a nap and heading out early in the morning.

We took a train to get into the main part of Paris, this train had two floors and looked like it came out of Back to the Future. We then stood outside the Notre Dame for a while before stumbling upon a bird market and a pink trinket shop. I dragged my friends into a part of the catacombs where we had our faces embossed onto a coin. Then we sat outside doing the most French thing we could think of - eating Crepes outside the gothic and imposing Notre Dame.

We walked along the river, and spent the rest of our ‘Paris’ money on pieces of art, we took photos outside of the Louvre so we could say we had at least seen it. Then we spent the rest of the afternoon on a boat which went along the river Seine, we saw the Moulin Rouge building and the Kissing Bridge.

At that point we knew we had to at least look at the Eiffel Tower, so we did. It was a wire trap, a metal monster. We stayed for 5 minutes before we were swarmed by Parisian sellers - it was the worst part of Paris. I think we were in the biggest daze as we set back on the train, we didn’t even try to sit upstairs. We collapsed into our beds/mattresses for a few hours before we scrambled around to make another train.

Paris itself has an unwelcoming atmosphere to it. It was as if Paris was a friend who would let you inside their house, but never inside their bedroom. I could see it chewing us up and spitting us out if we were to stay just another day. We felt tired the whole time. The beautiful facade of Paris wouldn’t be forgotten, but we knew that if we were going to last months on this trip, that we would have to leave and never fully return. So we did.
