The most iconic landmark in Prague is an Astronomical clock. Each hour, a group of moving sculptures strike the clock - one of these sculptures is a skeleton. Prague is an underrated Gothic wonder, and I'll never understand why it's not everyone's number one holiday destination. Perhaps it's because it takes forever to get there.

The train from Budapest to Prague was seven hours. A seven hour journey with no designated seats - we sat on the floor of the train by a toilet. Luckily, this was the longest train journey we had to do, and it was the most sleep we were able to get at once on our whole trip.

Our hostel was this botanical beauty, the 20 person room was covered top to bottom in vines and plants. Everything was mahogany and ancient. Balconies surrounded the building, and a small courtyard was situated in the middle. Oh, and the hostel had a dog!
