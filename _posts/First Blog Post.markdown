Celebrities are Gods. They’re icons. They are our monarchs and leaders; and now they are our healers. The idea of ‘celebrity’ has been one which has consumed the average person for hundreds of years. We listen to their every word and every opinion, we cry at their weddings and mourn their deaths. The idea of obsessing over celebrities isn’t new, but ever since celebrities have gotten ahold of healing blogs, they’ve become dangerous.

Celebrities have always been held at the highest standard of beauty, they are everything we wish to be, both in health and looks. Due to this, we can’t help but listen to their every piece of advice, in the hopes that we can one day look like they do.

GOOP is a word which strikes terror down my every nerve. Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand GOOp works by striking at the self conscious women of the world in the hopes that they will desperately want to be the Goddess who is Gwyneth, so much so that they would sell their souls - and their houses - for the opportunity to replicate her beauty. Whether it’s inserting jade eggs into their vaginas or spraying their children with calming water to subdue them, there is nothing Gwyneth doesn’t offer on GOOP. Gwyneth was even sued for thousands of dollars due to the danger of her advice.

When we treat celebrities as the highest quality of advice givers, it does put us in a certain level of danger. Celebrities have also been at the front of the anti-vax protests. Suggesting that we shouldn’t vaccinate our children because of the ‘toxins’ found inside - toxins being the cure to diseases. This dangerous idea has led to the death of many infants who aren’t strong enough to fight off diseases, celebrity bloggers are at least most of the blame for this horrific trend.

At the end of the day, our obsession with elite celebrities won’t stop any time soon. However, maybe it’s time to stop trusting these Gods with our health, lives and children. How about instead of using vaginal jade eggs to cure yourself, it might be time to call your doctor instead… just something to think about.
