## Ingredients

Risotto
- 2 Tbsp olive oil
- 1 cup diced leeks, washed well
- 1 cup Arborio rice
- ½ cup dry white wine
- juice of 1 lemon
- 2 cup coarsely grated fresh beets
- 2 tsp chopped fresh thyme
- 2 tsp chopped fresh tarragon
- 3 cup vegatable stock
- salt and pepper
Fricassee
- 1 ½ lb(s) asparagus, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1 Tbsp olive oil
- 1 cup diced leeks, washed well
- ½ lb(s) button or cremini mushrooms, quartered
- 1 tsp chopped fresh thyme
- 1 tsp chopped fresh tarragon
- salt and pepper
- lemon juice, to taste
- chopped chives, for garnish


## Method

1. For the risotto, heat a heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat and add the oil.
2. Add the leeks and sauté until they are tender, about 5 minutes.
3. Add the rice and sauté for another minute, then add the wine and lemon juice, simmering while stirring until it has all been absorbed.
4. Add 1 cup of the vegetable stock, the grated beets, thyme and tarragon and reduce the heat to a gentle simmer.
5. Stir the rice frequently, adding the remaining stock, one cup at a time, after the previous addition has been fully absorbed.
6. Season to taste and serve.
7. While the risotto is cooking, prepare the fricassee. Blanch the asparagus in boiling, salted water for 2 minutes, then drain and rinse to cool.
8. Heat a large sauté pan over medium-high heat and add the oil.
9. Add the leeks, mushrooms, thyme and tarragon and sauté until the vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Add the blanched asparagus to warm it through, season and add the lemon juice to taste.
10. Serve the fricassee over the beet risotto.
