## Ingredients

- 100g cream cheese
- 100g creme fraiche
- 200g smoked salmon
- 1 lemon
- &#189; lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon of creamed horseradish
- 2 tablespoons of finely chopped fresh dill
- Caper berries



## Method

1. To begin, place all the ingredients except the capers in a food processor. Pulse until a pâté forms which still has some texture to it and is not a purée.
2. Taste to check the seasoning as smoked salmon can vary greatly in its saltiness. It may also need more lemon juice.
3. Serve with sliced bread, such as stout soda bread, and large caper berries.
