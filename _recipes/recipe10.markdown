## Ingredients

- 220g (1 cup) caster sugar
- 800g seedless watermelon, chopped
- 2 teaspoons rosewater (see note)
- 2 limes, zested, juiced
- 2 egg whites, lightly beaten
- Dried rose petals, (see note) to serve


## Method

1. Combine sugar and 500ml (2 cups) water in a saucepan and cook, stirring, over low heat for 5 minutes or until sugar dissolves. Refrigerate for 30 minutes or until cool.
2. Meanwhile, place watermelon, rosewater and lime juice in a blender and blend until smooth. Strain through a sieve, pressing with the back of a spoon to extract as much liquid as possible (youâ€™ll need 600ml watermelon juice). Combine watermelon juice and cooled sugar mixture.
3. Pour into a 1.5L (6-cup) container and freeze for at least 2 hours or until almost set.
4. Roughly break up sorbet and transfer to a food processor. Process until sorbet is smooth and has a soft, icy texture. Return to container and freeze for at least 2 hours or until firm. Repeat processing and freezing twice more.
5. Return sorbet to food processor with egg whites and zest, then process until pale and smooth.
6. Spoon sorbet into container, smooth surface with the back of a spoon, then scatter with dried rose petals. Freeze for at least 2 hours or until firm.
