## Ingredients

Beet Cashew Hummus
- 11/4 cup of raw cashews, soaked for at least two hours
- 1 medium beet
- 1/4 cup of fresh lemon juice
- 3 tablespoons of tahini
- 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil
- 1 tablespoon of water
- 2 cloves of garlic
- 1/2 teaspoon of salt
- Pinch cayenne
Almond Za’atar
- 1/3 cup dry roasted almonds
- 1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds
- 1 teaspoon sumac
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1/4 teaspoon of salt
- 1/4 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil
Garlic Tahini Yogurt Swirl
- 1/4 cup of yogurt
- 1 tablespoon tahini
- 1 large garlic clove
- 1/8 teaspoon salt


## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 450°F. Wrap the beet in a foil pouch and bake on a baking sheet for 40-50 minutes until soft and a knife slides right into the center. When finished baking, open the pouch and let it cool until cool enough to the touch (or rinse with cool water). Slip the beet out of the peel and slice it into a few chunks.
2. Meanwhile, prepare the tahini yogurt swirl. Whisk together all of the ingredients in a small bowl, adding 1/2 teaspoon of water to loosen it up if it's too thick. If making ahead, transfer to a small glass OXO Smart Seal Container and chill. Otherwise, chill until ready to serve
3. Meanwhile, prepare the almond za'atar. In a small bowl, combine the dry roasted almonds, toasted sesame seeds, sumac, dried thyme, salt, and olive oil. Toss to combine. If making ahead, transfer to a small glass OXO Smart Seal Container and set aside until ready to serve. Otherwise, set aside until ready to serve
4. Drain and rise the cashews well. Add soaked cashews to a high-powered blender or food processor Blend with with the sliced beet, lemon juice, tahini, olive oil, water, garlic, salt, and cayenne. Purée until completely smooth. If too thick, add another tablespoon of water or olive oil until desired creamy consistency.
5. If making ahead, use a rubber spatula to transfer to a medium OXO Smart Seal Container. Otherwise, transfer to a small serving bowl.
6. When ready to serve, swirl the beet cashew hummus into a bowl. Take a large spoonful of tahini yogurt sauce and swirl it on top with a spoon. Sprinkle with almond za'atar and, if desired, fresh thyme for garnish.
7. Serve with cucumber spears or crackers for dipping (or your favourite veggies and pita!)
