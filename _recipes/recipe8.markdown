## Ingredients

- 4 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons table salt
- 1 cup unsalted butter (room temperature)
- 1/3 cup vegetable oil
- 3 cups sugar
- 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
- 4 large eggs (room temperature)
- 2 cups buttermilk (room temperature)
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- 2 teaspoons cider vinegar
- Gel food colouring: rose and red


## Method

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line the bottom of your cake pans and your stainless steel bowl with parchment.
2. Sift flour and salt into a medium bowl and whisk together. Set aside
3. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter, oil, sugar, and vanilla on medium speed until well combined. About 5 minutes.
4. Add 1 tablespoon rose and 1/2 teaspoon red food colouring and beat until the batter is evenly coloured. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl to make sure all of the mixture is coloured.
5. Add the eggs, two at a time, beating until each addition is incorporated before adding the next. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula when necessary.
6. Add the flour mixture in four parts, alternating with the buttermilk in three parts, beating just until each addition is incorporated before adding the next; do not over mix.
7. In a small cup, combine the baking soda and vinegar. With the mixer running, immediately add the mixture to the batter. Beat for 10 seconds
8. Scrape the batter into prepared pans, and spread it so that it is smooth. Bake until a toothpick inserted comes out clean- about 45 minutes for the 9x13" pan or 55 minutes for 8" pans. Rotate your cakes half way through baking.
9. Once done baking, transfer to a wire rack and let your cakes cool completely in their pans before removing.
