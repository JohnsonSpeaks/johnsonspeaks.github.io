[![Gammon with Pineapple Salsa](/_uploads/gammon.jpg)](/_uploads/gammon.jpg)

## Ingredients

- 1 large gammon steak
- 1 teaspoon of oil
- 1 teaspoon of clear honey
- 100g of fresh pineapple
- 1 large red chilli
- 1 teaspoon of soft brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon of soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon of chopped fresh coriander


## Method

1. First, make the salsa. Mix together all of the ingredients (use 1‚ÅÑ2 a chilli for a milder flavour, all of it for a pungent one). Set aside while you cook the gammon.
2. Heat the grill for 3 mins. Use a thin-bladed knife to slice the gammon into 2 steaks, then snip the rind every 2-3cm. Lightly brush with oil. Grill for about 3 mins each side until just firm, then brush over the honey on one side and cook for 1 min more. Remove and leave to stand for 2-3 mins.
3. Serve the gammon with the salsa spooned over the top. Good with a chicory salad or green beans and chunky-cut chips.
