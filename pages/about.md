I was born travelling. I've never lived in a single place for more than 3 years. I was raised on living cheap and saving for the next adventure. When travelling around, the only constant things in my life were my books, and my writing. So I'm combining them all.

I set out with a notebook, a few savings, and some rules to make things interesting. When travelling, never stay in a single city for more than 24 hours, within that time I can do whatever I like. After 24 hours however, I have to leave. Let's see how it goes.
