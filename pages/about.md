This page is where you write something about yourself. You can add pictures so that people know where you come from or where you live.

This file is an example of a page in Jekyll, that automatically shows up in the header navigation, you can delete or modify this file freely.

This file is saved inside the _pages_ folder and is saved as _about.md_ . Any file in this folder (as long as it has  the YAML header) will automatically show up as a link in the header bar.

You should use **markdown**to write this text and this will automatically be converted to `HTML`.
